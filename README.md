# Restaurant_distributed

The problem:
"Events portray activities that take place when a group of students, enrolled in
Computação Distribuída, go to a famous restaurant downtown for a gourmet dinner
to celebrate the beginning of the second semester. There are three main locations
within the restaurant that should be accounted for: the table where the students
sit to have their meal, the kitchen where the chef prepares it according to the
orders placed by the students, and the bar where the waiter stands waiting for
service requests. There are, furthermore, three kinds of interacting entities:
N students , one waiter and one chef."

The main goal of this project is to design and implement a solution to the
problem given above in a distributed way.

This project was developed during the course of Distributed Computing, at the
University of Aveiro, under the supervision of Prof. António Rui Borges.
