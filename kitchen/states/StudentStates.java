/*
 * The problem:
 * "Events portray activities that take place when a group of students, enrolled in
 * Computação Distribuída, go to a famous restaurant downtown for a gourmet dinner 
 * to celebrate the beginning of the second semester. There are three main locations
 * within the restaurant that should be accounted for: the table where the students 
 * sit to have their meal, the kitchen where the chef prepares it according to the
 * orders placed by the students, and the bar where the waiter stands waiting for 
 * service requests. There are, furthermore, three kinds of interacting entities: 
 * N students , one waiter and one chef."
 * 
 * The main goal of this project is to design and implement a solution to the 
 * problem given above.
 * 
 * This project was developed during the course of Distributed Computing, at the 
 * University of Aveiro, under the supervision of Prof. António Rui Borges.
